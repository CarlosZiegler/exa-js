# EXA researcher

The EXA Researcher example project is available as a regular Javascript file and as a Javascript interactive Jupyter notebook.

To run the Javscript file, just install the SDKs with `npm install` and run with `node researcher.mjs`.

To run the Jupyter notebook, you need the Deno Javascript kernel for Jupyter.

[Installing Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) and [connecting Deno to Jupyter](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/jupyter) is quick and easy.

Then just open `researcher.ipynb` in Jupyter just like a Python notebook, switch to the Deno kernel, and enjoy!
